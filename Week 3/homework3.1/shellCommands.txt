Problem : Write a program in the language of your choice that will remove the lowest homework score for each student. 
Since there is a single document for each student containing an array of scores, you will need to update the scores array and remove the homework.

 Provide the identity (in the form of their _id) of the student with the highest average in the class with following query that uses the aggregation 
 framework. The answer will appear in the _id field of the resulting document.
 
> db.students.aggregate( { '$unwind' : '$scores' } , { '$group' : { '_id' : '$_id' , 'average' : { $avg : '$scores.score' } } } , { '$sort' : { 'average' : -1 } } , { '$limit' : 1 } )
{ "_id" : 13, "average" : 91.98315917172745 }

Answer : 13
